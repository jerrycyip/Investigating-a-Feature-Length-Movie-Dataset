# Investigating-a-Feature-Length-Movie-Dataset
Exploratory investigation against a dataset of feature length movies from 1960 to 2015 to gain insights about factors that drive movie popularity and revenue and how those can change from year to year.  Exploratory questions include:
1) Which genres are most popular from year to year?
2) What kinds of properties are associated with movies that have high revenues?
3) What is the highest grossing movie of all time?

Initial dataset 'tmdb-movies.csv' (from The Movie Database https://www.themoviedb.org/) is provided and analysis is performed in Python and Jupyter notebooks while leveraging popular Python data analytics and data science packages: pandas, numpy, matplotlib and seaborn.  To aid our analysis we employ matplotlib and seaborn to create data visuals including pie charts and scatter plots.
